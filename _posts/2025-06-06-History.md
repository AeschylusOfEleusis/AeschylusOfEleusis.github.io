# Notes on Quantum Field Theory (Draft)

## Abstract
A technical history of quantum field theory is considered here using primary sources, historical text books on quantum field theory, and formal historical analyses (including scientific biographies and first hand accounts). With roots in quantum electrodynamics, the history of quantum field theory diverges (and subsequently reconverges) with respect to gauge theory, many-body theory, and renormalization; as evidenced by field theoretic approaches in disciplines such as high energy and condensed matter physics. Consequently, there is often considerable intersection between these disciplines. Selection of materials provided here echo this divergence and reconvergence over time. Outside of a particular historical role of any particular source, the primary criteria for selection of sources here is illustration of the precision and breadth of quantum field theory.
