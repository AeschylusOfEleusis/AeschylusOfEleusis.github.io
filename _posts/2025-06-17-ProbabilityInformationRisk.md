# Notes on Probability, Information, & Risk  (Draft)

## Abstract
Resources (with short notes) are provided concerning probability, information and risk. Both the frequentist and Bayesian views are considered; including Kolmogorov's axiomatic foundations and application of Bayesian probability in Mumford's Pattern Theory. The section on information includes Shannon's general theory, several survey articles (considering physics and geometry); and applications to computational complexity and coding theory. The section on risk considers the mathematics of games and gambling; including, the information theoretic Kelly's Criterion (as advocated by E. O. Thorp and associated practitioners).
