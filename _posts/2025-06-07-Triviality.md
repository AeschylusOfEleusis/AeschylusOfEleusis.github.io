# Notes on Renormalization (Draft)

## Abstract
Renormalization of the eﬀective potential is considered using autonomous and perturbative conventions. The primary focus of attention is the triviality of $\lambda \left[\Phi^{2}\right]_{4}^{2}$. Several examples are considered including an interacting scalar field, scalar quantum
electrodynamics, and scalar Yang Mills theory. Effects of finite temperature, background spacetime curvature, and multiple loops are also considered. For completeness the approach of Halpern-Huang and long-range effects are also included.
