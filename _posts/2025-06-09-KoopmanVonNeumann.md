# Notes on Koopman von Neumann Mechanics (Draft)

## Abstract
Brief notes concerning Koopman von Neumann mechanics are provided. Following an introductory section on KvN mechanics, Feynman's approach to the foundations of gauge theory (using commutator equations) is considered prior to a survey of the literature concerning the classical path integral. Notably, the section on Feynman's approach reveals a subtlety in the Helmholtz conditions for ordinary differential quations derivable from a Lagrangian. The exception concerns equations $\dot{x}^{i} = \varphi^{i}\left(x^{j}\right)$ appearing universally in the first order formalism. Connections between the symplectic geometry of classical phase space, gauge theories and quantization conditions are surveyed.
