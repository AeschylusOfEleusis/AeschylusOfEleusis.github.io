# Notes on Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (Draft)

## Abstract

Original primary sources concerning the foundations of Quantum Mechanics are provided. Associated historical circumstances are described in texts interspersed with the technical literature. The sources are roughly grouped by the schools of thought for the various interpretations. This collection of primary sources is at best an idiosyncratic sampling of the literature (far from exhaustive with respect to either the number of interpretations or the literature of a particular interpretation).
