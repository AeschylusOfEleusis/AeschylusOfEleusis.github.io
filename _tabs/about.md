Thank you for visiting this archive! Here is a little about what you will find here. The articles are research notes for students and practitioners interested in learning more about a given subject (and its literature). The notes are written in the pedagogical traditions of [D. J. Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Griffiths) and [N. A. Wheeler](https://www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/wheeler/). In his lecture notes, Wheeler described a technique of "*writing toward understanding*"; which is the method I've used here. The notes are then idiosyncratic guides to the literature that mirror the structure of the subject considered. In the latter sense, the notes are reviews of the various subjects.  Finally, the notes provide framework for the projects in github repositories. Above all, I hope you find topics that interest you in any time you spend here.
