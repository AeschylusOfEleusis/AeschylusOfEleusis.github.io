The articles are research notes for students and practitioners interested in learning more about a given subject and its literature. The notes are written in the pedagogical traditions of [D. J. Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Griffiths) and [N. A. Wheeler](https://www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/wheeler/). In his lecture notes, Wheeler described a technique of "*writing toward understanding*"; which is the method used here. The notes are then idiosyncratic guides to the literature that mirror the structure of the subject under consideration. In the latter sense, the notes are reviews of the various subjects.  Finally, the notes provide framework for the projects in github repositories.
