Thank you for visiting this archive! 

The archive is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com) using the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme ["chirpy"](https://chirpy.cotes.page). The theme enjoys a light and dark mode available in the lower left hand corner. Like analog chalk on a blackboard, the dark mode helps reading articles heavy with equations. The light mode presents articles as if they were pages in a book. The reader is left to choose the mode that is most helpful to them. 

The articles are research notes for students and practitioners interested in learning more about a given subject (and its literature). The notes are written in the pedagogical traditions of [D. J. Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Griffiths) and [N. A. Wheeler](https://www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/wheeler/). In his lecture notes, Wheeler described a technique of "*writing toward understanding*"; which is the method I've used here. The notes are then idiosyncratic guides to the literature that mirror the structure of the subject considered. In the latter sense, the notes are reviews of the various subjects.  Finally, the notes provide framework for the projects in github repositories. 

Most importantly, in any or your time that you spend here, I hope that you find topics or questions of interest.
